# MiniMcGee
A tiny robot with a big heart (Made of raspberries!)

## Purpose
This robot was designed as a test of my own personal skill, as well as for fun.
I desgined it to pack as much tech in it as I physically could at the time, and from there it turned from a game of hardware
to that of software.

## Development

An album of hardware development can be found here:

Everything except the mecanum wheels was hand modeled in Autodesk Inventor, special thanks to Jonah_Innoart on thingiverse
for modelling that. [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1358552](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1358552)

As for software development, the driver control became possible within a few months, via a bluetooth Xbox controller,
which was then followed by wifi control connected to a laptop. A year later, the camera view was implemented.

Programmed in Java, with the libraries Pi4J and JInput.

## Plans for the Future
Right now, a MiniMcGeeV2 is being designed in Inventor. This version 2 will use the Raspberry Pi Zero W and an ATMega (for hardware PWM and analog signals), as well as an onboard battery and charging circuit. The biggest change, however, will be in the drivetrain. This version will use a swerve drive type, allowing it more maneuverability over different terrains.
