# MiniMcGee
A tiny robot with a big heart (Made of raspberries!)

## Purpose
This robot was designed as a test of my own personal skill, as well as for fun.
I desgined it to pack as much tech in it as I physically could at the time, and from there it turned from a game of hardware
to that of software.

## Development

An album of hardware development can be found here:

Everything except the mecanum wheels were hand modeled in Autodesk Inventor, special thanks to Jonah_Innoart on thingiverse
for modelling that. [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1358552](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1358552)

As for software development, the driver control became possible within a few months, via a bluetooth Xbox controller,
which was then followed by wifi control connected to a laptop. A year later, the camera view was implemented.
